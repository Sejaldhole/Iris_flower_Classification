# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** based on their sepal and petal measurements. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is the classic **Iris dataset** from scikit-learn.
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target: Flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Train-test split
- Model training using **Decision Tree / Random Forest / Logistic Regression**
- Model evaluation with accuracy score and confusion matrix
- Model saving and loading using `joblib`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or upload files to your Kaggle Notebook.
2. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.
3. Use the saved model to make predictions on new samples.

```python
# Example usage after loading the model
import joblib

model = joblib.load("iris_model.pkl")
sample = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]
prediction = model.predict(sample)
print("Predicted class:", prediction)
